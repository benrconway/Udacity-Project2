# Full Stack Web Developer Nanodegree
## Project 2: Create a Portfolio Website

For this project in my Nanodegree, I have been tasked with creating a portfolio
website that follows a given design mockup and to then make it responsive.

You will be able to find my current latest interation of this website in the
master branch of this repository. To view it, please clone the repository
onto your machine and then open the *index.html* file in your browser of choice.

If I have done my work right, it should be appropriately responsive.

Should you have any issues or wish to make recommmendations, please send them
to myself at *benrconway84@gmail.com*

Thank you very much and I hope you enjoy.
